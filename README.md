# About:
#### This program was created for a project I was doing in my STEM Pathway class, it was created using TeachableMachine, and data scraping scripts I put together for the gathering of data, it supports the detection of unmasked people, masked people, and pets(dogs and cats)
# Using it and good things to know:
#### You can find all the data the algorithm uses and modify it to your liking if desiring under the directory "/MaskDetectionData"
#### My datascraping scripts can be found under the "/data" directory, I chose to manually find face pictures so there isn't a script for that
#### To add your own pictures to check for masks in, add them to the root of this directory after cloning. See the steps below to get started cloning this code and running it

## Running It:
### 1. Clone Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheProtonDev/MaskDetection.git
```
### 2. CD Into Directory
```sh
cd MaskDetection
```
### 3. Ensure you have all required dependencies installed by running 
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 4. Run It
```sh
./main.py
```
